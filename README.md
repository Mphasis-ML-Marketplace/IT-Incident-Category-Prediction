# IT-Incident-Category-Prediction

## Product Overview
This solution analyzes textual description of incidents from ticket data to predict its category. It uses an attention based pretrained model to  classify the tickets over a predefined set of incident categories using these textual descriptions. These incident categories along with the respective tickets are provided as output which can be used by an IT service management tool. This reduces the efforts required by L0 associates to read through the description and assign the categories.

## Product Highlight
* A Deep Learning solution with Transformer based learners predicts the incident category of tickets based on the description provided by the user. The prediction engine comprises a pre-trained model to predict the incident category of the tickets. This requires no training and the models are pre-built.
* The set of incident categories used by the Transformer learners are identified from the textual description using NLP based ML approaches. These data driven categories are prominent topics that have generalized coverage (relevance) spanning the IT ticket data of various business verticals.
* InfraGraf is a patented Cognitive infrastructure automation platform that optimizes enterprise technology infrastructure investments. It diagnoses and predicts infrastructure failures. Need customized Machine Learning and Deep Learning solutions? Get in touch!.
